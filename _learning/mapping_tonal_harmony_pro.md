## Overview

Mapping Tonal Harmony Pro is a comprehensive application for learning, analyzing, practicing, and composing using tonal harmony concepts across various styles. Its core strengths are:

1.  **Visual Harmony Map:** Represents harmonic functions, regions (tonic, subdominant, dominant), and cadences visually based on the circle of fifths.
2.  **Linked Components:** Sound playback, staff notation (analysis), and the map are interactively linked.
3.  **Customizable Backing Tracks:** AI players generate piano/guitar voicings and basslines based on harmonic functions and chord-scales for practice.
4.  **In-depth Analysis:** Automatically analyzes progressions for key centers, modulations, pivot chords, functions, and chord-scales.
