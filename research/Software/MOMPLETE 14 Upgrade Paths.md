# Your S88 MK2 Purchase and Upgrade Options: A Summary

## Your Current Situation

You purchased a Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol S88 MK2 keyboard, which came bundled with KOMPLETE 14 SELECT software. This bundle serves as an entry-level introduction to Native Instruments' sound libraries and includes:

- Kontakt 7 (player version)
- Approximately 18-19 instruments and effects
- About 15,000 sounds in a 40GB package
- 8 expansion packs
- Basic instruments like Massive, Battery 4, and several Play Series instruments
- Limited versions of software (Reaktor Player, etc.)

## Your Upgrade Paths

You have several options moving forward:

1. **Keep Using KOMPLETE 14 SELECT**
   - Cost: $0 (you already own it)
   - Pros: Already functional, no additional cost
   - Cons: Limited sound library compared to higher tiers

2. **Upgrade to KOMPLETE 15 Standard**
   - Regular Cost: ~$399 upgrade from SELECT
   - Sale Cost: ~$199 (during Summer of Sound or Black Friday)
   - Gains: Full versions of software, 87+ instruments/effects, 43,000+ sounds, 38+ expansion packs
   - Key additions: Full Kontakt 7, premium pianos, orchestral libraries, professional effects suite

3. **Upgrade to KOMPLETE 15 Ultimate or Collector's Edition**
   - Cost: Substantially higher ($599-$999+ even on sale)
   - Gains: Extensive orchestral and cinematic libraries, more specialized instruments
   - Best for: Film scoring, game audio, or professional production studios

## Recommended Strategy

1. **Wait for a sale** - Native Instruments typically runs their "Summer of Sound" promotion in June and Black Friday sales in November, offering 50% discounts on upgrades.

2. **Consider the Standard upgrade** - This represents the best value proposition, dramatically expanding your sound palette without the premium price of Ultimate.

3. **Register your product in Native Access** - Ensure you've properly registered your S88 MK2 and KOMPLETE 14 SELECT to qualify for upgrade pricing.

4. **Check your specific upgrade path** - Log into your Native Instruments account on their website to see personalized upgrade options based on what you already own.

The Standard upgrade would particularly benefit you if you need the full version of Kontakt for third-party libraries, want high-quality acoustic instruments, or would benefit from the expanded effects suite. At the sale price of around $199, it represents excellent value compared to purchasing individual instruments.
