*This document consolidates the key points from the initial brainstorming conversations that led to the "Sky" project structure.*

## Initial Problem & Context (From Brainstorm 1)

The initial discussion focused on addressing a storage and workflow challenge for managing a growing volume of media (drone footage, iPhone photos/videos) alongside original piano/orchestral compositions. Key goals included:

*   Finding the "smoothest workflow" for production (video editing, music scoring).
*   Managing storage across devices (iPhone 250GB, MacBook 1TB) and cloud options (Google Workspace, iCloud 2TB, OneDrive 2TB).
*   Considering an external 4TB SSD (specifically Samsung T7 Shield vs. SanDisk options were discussed).
*   Evaluating NLE software (DaVinci Resolve vs. Final Cut Pro, leaning towards FCP).
*   Preserving media quality while wanting ease of access and avoiding overly manual steps.

## Early AI Suggestions & Automation Focus (From Brainstorm 1)

Initial AI suggestions leaned heavily towards technical solutions and automation:

*   Detailed SSD setup and benchmarking.
*   Specific FCP library configurations (media external, cache internal).
*   Complex backup strategies (3-2-1, Backblaze, cloud mirroring).
*   Automated FCPXML round-trips between FCP and Logic Pro.
*   Suggestions for Hazel/Automator rules for file ingestion.

## Pivot Point: Cursor & Rejection of Complexity (From Brainstorm 1)

A key shift occurred when the user decided to manage this entire process within Cursor (VS Code fork), leveraging its terminal integration and file management capabilities. The user explicitly rejected the AI's increasingly complex automation suggestions:

> "See here's a thing. You totally took my idea and fucked it all up. I want deep research on how to set up a workflow in cursor. You've gone into a crazy land of automating shit that I've never even worked with... Like zoom out I'm looking for a way to set up documents and project management and take advantage of the fact that we could do this kind of film an audio production and manage it from cursor. You went way too deep in particular weird direction."

This demanded a reset towards a simpler, more foundational approach focused on organization, documentation, and basic helpers within the Cursor environment. The goal became a "clean, low-friction* repo structure and Markdown templates."

## Refined Vision: The Creative Laboratory (From Brainstorm 2)

Following the reset, the user elaborated on the vision for the workspace within Cursor, describing it as a comprehensive "creative laboratory":

*   **Integrated Knowledge Management:** A central place to organize sample libraries, gear inventory, technical know-how, and resources ("database cheat sheet").
*   **Project Planning & Organization:** Tools to outline projects, brainstorm ideas (e.g., orchestrating specific footage), and track work history.
*   **Embedded Research:** The ability to conduct research (on composers, techniques, software features) directly within Cursor, capturing findings in journals or the knowledge base.
*   **Documentation:** Logging the learning journey and project progress.
*   **Templates:** Developing standardized templates over time.

## Accepted Structure & Template Proposals (From Brainstorm 2)

The AI then proposed a simpler structure and documentation approach aligned with the refined vision:

*   **Proposed Folder Structure:**
    ```
    CreativeStudio/ (or similar name)
    ├── knowledge-base/
    │   ├── sample-libraries.md
    │   ├── gear-inventory.md
    │   └── techniques/
    ├── projects/
    │   ├── _templates/
    │   └── [project_name]/
    ├── research/
    ├── journal/
    ├── scripts/ (for basic helpers)
    └── README.md
    ```
*   **Markdown Templates:** Examples were provided for:
    *   `Sample Libraries Catalog`
    *   `Project Brief`
    *   `Daily Journal Entry`
*   **Basic Scripts:** A simple `new-project.sh` bash script was suggested for scaffolding new project folders.
*   **Integration:** Using a `links.md` file within projects to reference media on the external SSD via file paths or application-specific URLs (e.g., `finalcut://`, `logic://`).

## Naming the Project (From Brainstorm 2)

Several names were considered for the workspace folder. The user proposed "Skylabs", which was deemed fitting as it suggested creativity, experimentation, drone footage ("sky"), and technical work ("labs"). This led to the final base structure name adopted by the project.

*This consolidated log captures the journey from the initial workflow problem to the refined concept of the "Sky" workspace as an integrated creative laboratory managed within Cursor.*
