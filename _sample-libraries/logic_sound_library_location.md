# Logic Pro Sound Library Location

*Last updated: 2025-04-28*

This document confirms the location of the core Logic Pro Sound Library content (Apple Loops, EXS Samples, Alchemy Samples, Ultrabeat Samples, etc.) after using Logic's built-in "Relocate Sound Library" feature.

To prioritize simplicity and avoid potential issues with unsupported configurations, the standard relocation path provided by Logic Pro was accepted.

**Location on External Drive:**

The main Sound Library content resides at the following path on the primary media drive:

`/Volumes/T7_Media_Vault/Library/Application Support/Logic/`

**Management:**

- This content is managed via Logic Pro's Sound Library Manager (Logic Pro > Sound Library > ...).
- Refer to the main `knowledge-base/sample-libraries/catalog.md` for curated third-party libraries.
