# Sample Library Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the main sample library manufacturers and platforms available in the `/Volumes/T7_Media_Vault/Sample_Libraries` directory.

## Libraries by Manufacturer/Platform

1.  **IK Multimedia (SampleTank / `Imported Instruments`)**:
    *   **Key Sounds:** Very broad range covering standard band instruments (bass, guitar, drums - acoustic & electronic), orchestral sections (strings, brass, woodwinds, percussion), keyboards (piano, organ), synths, ethnic instruments, and vocals. Seems like a large, general-purpose collection, primarily using `.st3i` presets.

2.  **Native Instruments (`NI` / Kontakt likely)**:
    *   **Key Sounds:** Primarily focused on orchestral and cinematic sounds (Anthology Strings, Century Brass/Strings, Lacrimosa/Requiem Choirs, Majestica orchestra, Intimate Strings, Hybrid Tools), but also includes some unique items (Irish Harp, Jacob Collier Choir, Kinetic Treats) and NI ecosystem content (Expansions Selection, Reaktor Selection, TRK-01 Bass). Likely uses Kontakt (`.nki`, `.nkm`) or Komplete Kontrol (`.nksn`) formats.

3.  **Orchestral Tools (`SINE`)**:
    *   **Key Sounds:** Strong emphasis on orchestral instruments, both ensemble (`Berlin Free Orchestra`, `Layers`) and solo sections/instruments. Also includes specific non-orchestral libraries like percussion (`Dynamo`, `Gearbox`), basses (`Crux`), keys (`Roads`, `Spindle`), guitars (`Strand`), organs (`Clutch`, `Crucible`), and unique textures (`Formby`, `Lucent`, `Manifold`). Uses the dedicated SINE player format.

4.  **Spitfire Audio (`Spitfire` / `Spitfire LABS`)**:
    *   **Key Sounds:** Significant focus on orchestral (`BBC Symphony Orchestra`, `Spitfire Symphony Orchestra`, Originals Epic/Intimate series, LABS Strings/Frozen Strings), choir (`Eric Whitacre Choir`, Originals Epic Choir), pianos (Originals Cinematic Soft/Firewood/Intimate Grand, LABS Intimate Grand), cinematic textures (Originals Pads/Percussion, LABS Atmos/Swells/Pads), and a wide variety of experimental/character sounds via the extensive LABS collection (Guitars, Synths, Drums, Cello Quartet, etc.). Uses dedicated Spitfire plugins or Kontakt formats.

5.  **UVI (`UVISoundBanks` / UVI Workstation/Falcon)**:
    *   **Key Sounds:** Mix of orchestral (`Orchestral Suite`, `Augmented Orchestra`, `SubCulture Orchestral`), keyboards (various Pianos, `Key Suite Acoustic`, `Retro Organ Suite`, `Organic Keys`), sound design (`Whoosh FX`, `Atmospherics`, `Cinematic Shades`, `Fluidity`, `Aurora`), drums (`Drum Designer`), and specialized instruments (`IRCAM Solo Instruments 2`, `Glass Orchestra`). Includes factory content for Falcon. Uses the `.ufs` soundbank format for UVI Workstation or Falcon.
