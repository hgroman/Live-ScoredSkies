# Sky Project - Core Vision & Systems

## Vision Statement
Create emotionally resonant cinematic pieces where breathtaking drone footage is paired with custom-composed orchestral music that elevates and interprets the visual experience. Each project should carry the emotional impact of seeing landscapes through both lens and sound.

## Core Creative Process
1. **Capture** - DJI Mini 4K drone footage of natural landscapes
2. **Structure** - Rough edit in Final Cut Pro with timecode markers
3. **Compose** - Piano themes on S88 MK2 while watching footage in Logic Pro
4. **Orchestrate** - Build arrangements using high-quality sample libraries
5. **Synthesize** - Final integration back to Final Cut Pro for polished delivery

## Essential Technical Stack

### Hardware
*Refer to [`_hardware/_hardware-catalog.md`](_hardware/_hardware-catalog.md) for detailed hardware information.*

### Software
*Refer to [`_software/_software-catalog.md`](_software/_software-catalog.md) for detailed software information.*

### Sample Libraries (Core Palette)
*Refer to [`_sample-libraries/_sample-library-catalog.md`](_sample-libraries/_sample-library-catalog.md) for detailed sample library information.*

## Workflow Integration Points

### FCP → Logic → FCP Pipeline
- Export timecoded reference from FCP (H.264, burned timecode)
- Import to Logic Pro (48kHz, matching frame rate)
- Compose with video reference and SMPTE display
- Export final mix back to FCP for finishing

### S88 Light Guide Orchestration
- Map orchestral sections to Light Guide zones
- Real-time visual feedback while composing to picture
- Seamless transition from piano sketch to full orchestration

### Media Organization
- External drive: `/Sample_Libraries/`, `/Media/`, `/Audio_Projects/`
- Project structure: Video, Audio, Documents per project
- Keyword tagging for footage (sunset, pan, close-up, etc.)

## Creative Principles
- **Sync is Sacred**: Musical events must enhance visual narrative
- **Landscape as Character**: Each location has its musical voice
- **Dynamic Range**: Preserve orchestral dynamics, avoid over-compression
- **Iterative Refinement**: Picture and music can inform each other

## Project Locations & Moods
- **Lake Tahoe**: Expansive, reflective, golden hour magic
- **Lone Pine**: Rugged, dramatic, eastern Sierra grandeur  
- **Idyllwild**: Intimate, forested, closer perspective
- **Coastal**: Rhythmic, eternal, horizon-focused

## Success Metrics
- Emotional resonance: Does the combination move the viewer?
- Technical excellence: Clean sync, professional polish
- Artistic growth: Each project builds compositional and visual skills
- Sustainable workflow: Systems support creativity, not hinder it
