# Sky Workspace Genesis

## 2025-04-27 12:13:50 PDT - Birth of a Creative Environment

**Focus:** Establishing a unified workspace where my drone footage, piano compositions, and orchestration can come together as cohesive artistic pieces.

**The Vision That Started It All:**
This workspace isn't about "project management" - it's about creating a home for my creative process. The genesis was simple: I have this beautiful footage from my DJI Mini 4K drone capturing Tahoe, Lone Pine, Idyllwild, and coastal scenes. I want to compose piano and orchestrated music that perfectly complements these visual landscapes, creating something that resonates emotionally with viewers.

**My Creative Arsenal:**
- **Visual Capture:** DJI Mini 4K drone, iPhone ProRes, Insta360 Flow gimbal
- **Music Production:** Komplete Kontrol S88 MK2 keyboard (my main instrument), Logic Pro
- **Sample Libraries:** Spitfire Symphony Orchestra, Eric Whitacre Choir, 8Dio Modern Scoring Bundle, Originals Firewood Piano, and many more Kontakt instruments
- **Video Production:** Final Cut Pro (soon)
- **Audio Monitoring:** Edifier MR4 near-fields
- **Storage & Processing:** MacBook Pro M2 Max, Samsung T7 Shield 4TB (ordered)

**The Workflow Vision:**
The workflow I'm designing is deeply interconnected:
1. Capture breathtaking footage with the drone
2. Edit and arrange visual sequences in Final Cut Pro
3. Export timecoded XML to Logic Pro
4. Use my S88 keyboard to compose piano themes while watching the footage
5. Orchestrate around those themes using my extensive sample libraries
6. Fine-tune the arrangement with the visual narrative
7. Export final audio back to Final Cut
8. Create beautiful, emotionally resonant audio-visual pieces

**What Makes This Special:**
The Light Guide on the S88 mapping to orchestral sections. The ability to see time-code locked video in Logic while playing. The real-time experience of seeing my fingers on piano keys translate to lush string arrangements supporting drone footage of Lake Tahoe at sunset. *That's* the magic this workspace needs to support.

**Why Cursor Is the Hub:**
What's been missing is a central nervous system - a place where all the knowledge, inspiration, notes, and technical solutions live. Instead of having scattered notes and disorganized projects, Cursor lets me:
- Document my growing understanding of orchestration techniques
- Keep track of the best sample articulations for specific emotional effects
- Research how composers like Debussy constructed their harmonic progressions
- Plan sound designs that will complement specific landscape shots
- Organize footage and composition ideas in a structured way

**Where We Are Now:**
Today I've established the foundational structure for Sky. The workspace includes:
1. `/knowledge-base` - Where I'll document everything I learn about orchestration, sample libraries, composition techniques
2. `/projects` - Individual creative pieces, each with standardized video/audio/document organization
3. `/research` - A place to store explorations, deep dives into compositional techniques, studies of other works
4. `/journal` - This ongoing record of the creative journey
5. `/_templates` and `/_scripts` - Tools to make the creative process smoother

**Next Steps:**
- Finish setting up the scripts for project creation
- Create a master catalog of all my sample libraries in the knowledge base
- Begin documenting the orchestration techniques I want to explore
- Start planning my first project combining Tahoe drone footage with piano + strings

This workspace isn't just folders and files - it's the soil where I'll plant and grow compositions that marry visual and musical storytelling. Every project that emerges from here should carry the emotional impact of seeing breathtaking landscapes paired with music that elevates and interprets the visual experience.
