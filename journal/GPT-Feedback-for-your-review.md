Got it — your workspace is *conversation-driven*, with the AI pair-coder acting as a hands-on teammate inside Cursor.  Scripts are optional helpers, not the primary interface. Let’s tune the advice to that reality and to the tree you just showed.

---

## 1 · Quick reactions to the current tree

```
Sky/
├── _scripts/            # only used when a CLI helper is genuinely faster
├── _templates/          # good! single source of truth for docs
├── journal/
├── knowledge-base/
├── projects/
└── research/
```

**✅ Strengths**

* Very clear top-level intent folders.
* `_templates` isolates boilerplate so prompts like “open Project_Brief.md template” stay simple.
* Single `journal/` keeps the creative log in one chron chain.

**⚠️ Minor tweaks**

| Suggestion | Why | How (conversational) |
|------------|-----|----------------------|
| **Rename `_scripts/` → `tools/`** | Communicates “optional utilities, not required plumbing.” | “AI, rename the `_scripts` folder to `tools` and update any docs.” |
| **Add `assets/`** | Drop logos, LUTs, reference PDFs in one neutral place so projects can symlink instead of copy. | “AI, create `assets/` with sub-folders `LUTs/` and `Logos/`.” |
| **Add `README.now.md`** | A living scratchpad for *current* goals—reduces revisiting the Genesis entry each time. | Prompt: “Append a Today section to `README.now.md` with what I’m tackling.” |

## 2 · Conversational workflows (no bash required)

| Task | Interactive workflow you can speak to Cursor AI |
|------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Create new project** | “Generate a project folder inside `projects/` called `Tahoe_Sunset` based on the template in `_templates/Project_Structure_README.md`.” |
| **Daily journal entry** | “Open a new journal file dated today, using the Journal_Entry template; title it ‘First drone + piano sketch’.” |
| **Add sample lib** | “Append ‘Cinematic Frozen Strings – LABS – free – installed 2025-04-28’ to `knowledge-base/sample_catalogue.md`.” |
| **Pull research snippet** | “In `research/`, create `reverb_tails.md` summarizing how Ravel voices strings in high registers and link the score.” |

Your AI partner does the filenaming, markdown scaffolding, and git add/commit in one go if you ask.

## 3 · Deep-research prompts that *fit* this style

1. **Shot–Cue Matrix**
   *Prompt:*
   > “Research best practices for mapping film scenes to musical cue sheets. Produce a markdown table template I can drop in any project’s `/03_Documents/` folder.”

2. **Kontakt Patch Lookup**
   > “Given my current sample libs (see `knowledge-base/sample_catalogue.md`), list five go-to articulations for intimate string scoring and note velocity layers.”

3. **Logic Marker Color Guide**
   > “Find up-to-date workflows for coloring Logic markers by emotion category (tension, release, wonder) and document a color key I can paste into the knowledge base.”

Each returns pure Markdown (plus links) ready to slot into your folders—no code unless you request it.

## 4 · Tiny quality-of-life asks you can make to AI

* “Create a Mermaid diagram of the current project dependencies.”
* “Generate a TODO list from unchecked boxes across the `projects/Tahoe_Sunset` tree.”
* “Search the repo for ⋯ and surface any duplicate file names.”

These leverage Cursor’s live file system view and keep everything AI-driven.

## 5 · Re-evaluated feedback for the Genesis journal

Add these two micro-sections (still conversational):

```markdown
## Current State Snapshot  (🟢 good | 🟡 in-progress | 🔴 blocked)
- 🟢 Folder scaffold complete
- 🟡 T7 Shield arriving tomorrow
- 🔴 Haven’t tested Logic time-coded video yet

## Open Questions
- How should I label drone clip versions vs. color-graded exports?
- Best key-switch map for Firewood Piano on the S88 Light Guide?
```

They seed future AI conversations and stop the journal from becoming a memory dump.

### Bottom line

* Keep talking to the AI; let it handle the mechanical file moves.
* Use **research prompts that output Markdown tables, cheat sheets, diagrams**—things that slot straight into `knowledge-base` or a project’s docs.
* Scripts live in `tools/` only when a single conversational command would be annoyingly long or repetitive.

Ping me whenever you want a specific research prompt phrased, or a template expanded, and we’ll keep the workspace evolving at conversational speed.
