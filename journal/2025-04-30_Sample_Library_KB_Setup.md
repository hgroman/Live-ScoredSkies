## Sample Library Knowledge Base Setup

Today, we established a structure for the sample library information within the `knowledge-base` to better support creative workflows.

**Tasks Completed:**

1.  **Created Overview:** Added `knowledge-base/sample-libraries/overview.md` containing a high-level summary of the main manufacturers/platforms found in the sample library directory.
2.  **Created Placeholder Notes:** Set up placeholder markdown files for more detailed future notes within manufacturer-specific subdirectories:
    *   `knowledge-base/sample-libraries/ik_multimedia/notes.md`
    *   `knowledge-base/sample-libraries/native_instruments/notes.md`
    *   `knowledge-base/sample-libraries/orchestral_tools/notes.md`
    *   `knowledge-base/sample-libraries/spitfire/notes.md`
    *   `knowledge-base/sample-libraries/uvi/notes.md`
3.  **Updated Main README:** Modified the main `README.md` file to link the "Sample Libraries" entry in the "Key Locations" section to the new `overview.md` file.

This structure provides a starting point for documenting key libraries, tips, and workflows without getting lost in excessive detail initially.
