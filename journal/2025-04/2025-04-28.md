## Sample Library Migration Complete (WO-1)

**Tasks Completed:**
- Successfully formatted the new 4TB T7 Shield SSD (`T7_Media_Vault`) as APFS.
- Created the standard top-level folders (`Media`, `Audio_Projects`, `Sample_Libraries`).
- Created organizational subfolders within `Sample_Libraries` (`NI`, `Spitfire`, `IK_Multimedia`, `Imported_Instruments`).
- Migrated sample libraries from the old 'Crucial X8' drive to the new T7 drive using `rsync`, organizing them into the new subfolders.
  - Sources copied: `Kontact 7 Player Libraries`, `Spitfire Audio - Eric Whitacre Choir`, `Spitfire Audio - LABS`, `Spitfire Audio - Spitfire Symphony Orchestra`, `SampleTank`, `Imported Instruments`.

**Notes:**
- The `rsync` process for the large libraries took a considerable amount of time but completed successfully.
- This marks a significant step in setting up the dedicated media drive for the Sky project.

**Next Steps (Ref WO-1):**
- [ ] Verify library structure with `tree` command.
- [ ] Update software paths (Native Access, Spitfire App, Kontakt).
- [ ] Update `knowledge-base/sample-libraries/catalog.md`.
- [ ] Migrate other media/project files if necessary.
- [ ] Verify & Backup.

## Session Wrap-up (2025-04-28)

**Summary:**
- Completed major steps of external drive preparation (Work Order WO-1): formatting, folder creation, sample library migration.
- Documented the migrated library structure in `knowledge-base/sample-libraries/catalog.md`.
- Confirmed and documented the location of the relocated Logic Pro Sound Library in `knowledge-base/logic_sound_library_location.md`.

**Note to Self (Next Steps Upon Resuming):**
- **Priority:** Complete **Task #5** from WO-1: Manually update library paths in Native Access, Spitfire App, Kontakt, UVI Portal.
- Verify library loading in Logic Pro.
- Review and refine details in `knowledge-base/sample-libraries/catalog.md`.
- Consider migrating any remaining old project files (Task #4).
- Address backup strategy for the new T7 drive (Task #7).
- Decommission old drive when ready (Task #8).

**Pausing work on Sky project for now due to other commitments.**
