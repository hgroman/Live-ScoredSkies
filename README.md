# Sky

*Where visual landscapes meet musical emotion. A creative sanctuary for drone footage and orchestral composition.*

## Creative Philosophy
*Last updated: 2025-04-27*

Sky is not mere project management—it's a creative ecosystem where breathtaking aerial vistas and emotional musical compositions merge into cohesive artistic experiences. My philosophy is simple yet profound:

> The emotional resonance between a landscape and its musical interpretation creates something greater than either element alone.

This workspace embodies four core principles:
1. **Visual-Musical Synergy** - Drone footage and orchestral compositions should enhance one another
2. **Emotional Authenticity** - Every piece should evoke genuine emotional responses
3. **Technical Excellence** - Structured organization enables creative freedom
4. **Purposeful Simplicity** - Eliminate the unnecessary so the necessary may speak

## The Power of Purposeful Simplicity

I believe in removing obstacles between inspiration and expression. This workspace is designed with intentional minimalism—keeping only what serves the creative process and eliminating everything that doesn't. This means:

- Clean, focused folder structures that make sense intuitively
- Documentation that clarifies rather than complicates
- Templates that reduce repetitive setup tasks
- Tools that solve real problems without adding complexity

Through deliberate simplification, creativity flows more naturally. When the technical aspects fade into the background, the artistic vision can take center stage.

- [x] Set up basic folder structure
- [x] Create sample library catalog
- [ ] Finalize external drive setup & backup (WO-2)
- [ ] Integrate scoring course materials (WO-2)
- [ ] Document FCP-Logic XML workflow
- [ ] Create first project for Tahoe drone footage

## Creative Arsenal

This workspace is where I combine my drone footage with original compositions using:
- DJI Mini 4K drone footage
- Logic Pro for music composition
- Komplete Kontrol S88 MK2 keyboard
- Spitfire, 8Dio and other sample libraries
- Final Cut Pro for video editing

The magic happens when the Light Guide on the S88 maps to orchestral sections while viewing time-code locked footage in Logic. Seeing my fingers on piano keys translate to lush string arrangements supporting drone footage of Lake Tahoe at sunset—that's the essence of this workspace.

## Why This Matters

This workspace isn't just folders and files—it's the soil where I plant and grow compositions that marry visual and musical storytelling. Every project that emerges from here carries the emotional impact of seeing breathtaking landscapes paired with music that elevates and interprets the visual experience.

Each element in this workspace exists with clear purpose. The organization is deliberate, the tools are essential, and the focus is singular: to create meaningful artistic expressions that connect visual beauty with musical emotion without unnecessary complexity getting in the way.
