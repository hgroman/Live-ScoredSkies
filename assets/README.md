# Assets

Shared resources that can be used across multiple projects:

- **logos/** - Brand and channel identifiers
- **LUTs/** - Color grading presets for video
- **templates/** - Reusable designs and patterns
- **documents/** - Standard text for descriptions, credits, etc.

## Folder Structure

- **logos/** - Brand logos, watermarks, and other visual identity elements that may be used across multiple videos
  - Place your channel logo, personal branding elements, or collaborator logos here
  - Example: `channel_logo.png`, `end_screen_template.png`

- **LUTs/** - Look-Up Tables for consistent color grading across projects
  - Color grading presets that can be applied in Final Cut Pro or other video editing software
  - Helps maintain a consistent visual style across different videos or series
  - Example: `cinematic_warm.cube`, `drone_landscape.cube`

- **templates/** - Reusable design templates
  - Title card designs, lower thirds, end screens, etc.
  - Reference compositions or arrangements
  - Example: `title_animation.mp4`, `end_credits.psd`

- **documents/** - Shared reference materials and standard documents
  - Bio/about information for video descriptions
  - Social media information
  - Release notes templates
  - Contact information
  - Example: `channel_description.md`, `social_links.md`

## Usage

When creating a new project, you can reference these shared assets rather than duplicating them. For example, in Final Cut Pro, you can create a favorite or link to LUTs stored here, or in your project documentation, you can link to the standard bio information.

This organization helps maintain consistency across projects while keeping the actual assets centrally managed and updated.
