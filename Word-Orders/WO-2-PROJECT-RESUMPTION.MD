# Work Order: Project Resumption & Refinement (WO-2)

**Date Created:** 2025-04-29 00:16:26 PDT
**Status:** Open
**Goal:** Address pending tasks from initial setup and integrate additional resources upon resuming work on the Sky project.

---

## Tasks:

### Pending from Drive Setup (Ref WO-1)

1.  **[ ] Migrate Remaining Media/Projects (WO-1 Task #4):**
    *   Review content on the old 'Crucial X8' drive.
    *   Copy any desired remaining FCP projects, Logic sessions, raw footage, or other relevant files to the appropriate `Media` or `Audio_Projects` folders on the `T7_Media_Vault` drive.

2.  **[ ] Final Verification & Backup Strategy (WO-1 Task #7):**
    *   Perform a final check that all essential data is migrated from the old drive.
    *   Implement a backup solution (e.g., Time Machine pointing to another drive, Backblaze cloud backup) for the `T7_Media_Vault` drive.

3.  **[ ] Decommission Old Drive (WO-1 Task #8):**
    *   Once backups are confirmed, securely eject and disconnect the 'Crucial X8' drive.
    *   Consider reformatting or storing it safely.

### Documentation & Resource Integration

4.  **[ ] Refine Sample Library Catalog:**
    *   Review `knowledge-base/sample-libraries/catalog.md`.
    *   Fill in missing details (purchase info, serials) for newly listed libraries (8Dio, UVI, etc.).
    *   Verify assumed folder names against actual structure on T7 drive.
    *   Confirm ProjectSAM Free Orchestra location.
    *   Inventory and document contents of `Imported_Instruments` folder if desired.
    *   Update `[Get Timestamp]` at the top of the file.

5.  **[ ] Review & Integrate Course Information:**
    *   **Explore Course Content:** Actively review modules/lessons within "Cinematic Orchestration - Legacy", Hans Zimmer MasterClass, and the Cinematic Composing bundle (Strings Instrumentation, Template in an Afternoon, etc.).
    *   **Extract Resources:** Identify and gather key materials (notes, templates, checklists, concepts, useful links) from each course.
    *   **Organize Knowledge:** Decide on the best location within the Sky structure to store/reference this information (e.g., create `knowledge-base/courses/[CourseName]_Notes.md`, or put relevant techniques under `knowledge-base/techniques/` or `research/`).
    *   **Document:** Add summaries, links, or extracted content to the relevant location(s) in the knowledge base, linking back from `knowledge-base/courses/orchestration_scoring_courses.md` where appropriate.

6.  **[ ] Plan Next Creative Steps:**
    *   Review the `Current Focus` section in the main `README.md`.
    *   Prioritize next actions (e.g., Document FCP-Logic workflow, Start Tahoe project editing/scoring).

**Notes:**

*   This work order consolidates remaining setup tasks and new integration goals.
*   Prioritize establishing backups for the new media drive.
